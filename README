This is a 'getwork' CPU mining client for bitcoin.

It is pure-python, and therefore very, very slow.  The purpose is to
provide a reference implementation of a miner, for study.

pyminer.py (for people who have only python2 on their system)

pyminer_dual_users.py (for people who have both python2 and python3)
